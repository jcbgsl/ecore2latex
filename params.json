The layout of documentation is inspired by the UML specification.\r\n\r\nThe feature will be installable in an Eclipse and will enable the creation of a .tex file for ecore models. IThe transformation will take into account the structure of the model  (EPackage, EClass, EEnumeration, ...) as well as annotations added to the model. Ideally, some configuration options will be possible, as the NS and key values for the annotations, the output file etc.\r\n\r\nThe M2T transformation will done by Acceleo based templates, as well as some Java code.\r\n\r\nThe CI is done on buildhive, and the actual status is [![Build Status](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jcbgsl/job/ecore2latex/badge/icon)](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jcbgsl/job/ecore2latex/) .\r\n\r\n"}
