Currently, the only update site existing is the one provided by the CI:

[https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jcbgsl/job/ecore2latex/ws/releng/de.developnow.ecore2latex.updatesite/target/repository/](https://buildhive.cloudbees.com/job/jcbgsl/job/ecore2latex/ws/releng/de.developnow.ecore2latex.updatesite/target/repository/)

It is built after each commit, so it is quite often possible that it will be broken, or may contain unstable or very unstable code.
